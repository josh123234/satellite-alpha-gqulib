## HOW - Planning & Implementation

### Technical Implementation

**Required Stack Components**

- Frontend: Web application using Angular with a responsive design for desktop and mobile access.

- Backend: Cloud-based server using Node.js handling data processing, integrations, and analytics

- Integrations: Complete and ready-to-use integrations for SaaS Discovery and SaaS Usage Insights (start with Google Workspace as first integration, but make it easy to add more integrations later)

- Infrastructure: Cloud infrastructure with robust security measures and scalable resources (AWS).

**Integration Details**

- **SaaS Discovery**

  - Necessary integrations:

    - Payment platforms (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)

    - Accounting systems (e.g., QuickBooks, Xero)

    - Email services (e.g., Google Workspace, Microsoft 365)

  - Purpose: Retrieve relevant data and  identify SaaS subscriptions by analyzing transactions and email receipts, either based on rules or using the AI-powered discovery capabilities described in the AI Functionality section below.

  - Configuration: Users will initiate integrations through a guided setup wizard within the application. This wizard will allow users to securely connect their accounts for each platform, granting the necessary permissions for data access. Clear instructions and real-time validation will ensure successful integration.

- **SaaS Usage Insights**

  - First integration: Google Workspace

    - Retrieve data on user  activity, app usage frequency, and associated costs.

    - Provide detailed analytics on active vs. inactive users.

  - Extendability: Build architecture to easily add integrations for other SaaS applications (e.g., Slack, Zoom).

**AI Functionality**

- **AI-Powered Discovery and Mapping**

  - Help  uncover the entire SaaS stack, including shadow IT, by leveraging AI to analyze payment data, accounting systems, and email logs as retrieved from the Shadow IT Discovery integration outlined above.

  - Provide actionable insights and customizable workflows for managing discovered applications.

  - Use AI to automatically identify SaaS applications and fill in relevant details, reducing manual effort in creating the SaaS System of Record.

- **AI Contract Ingestion**

  - Automatically parse SaaS contracts and their line items, eliminating manual data entry. These parsed details, such as subscription name, renewal date, cost per user, and included features, are seamlessly integrated into actionable insights within dashboards and reports. Users can view aggregated data for cost tracking and identify optimization opportunities directly from the system. These contracts can be 1) uploaded as a PDF, 2) found in email during shadow IT discovery, or 3) retrieved from an enabled SaaS Usage Insights integration.

  - Example: Extract details such as subscription name, renewal date, cost per user, and included features. This data will be integrated into the system for streamlined cost tracking and renewal management.

  - Seamlessly integrate contract details into the system for cost tracking and management.

- **AI Assistant**

  - Allow users to query SaaS-related questions via a conversational AI interface, such as a Slack bot.

  - Provide instant insights about users, contracts, and licenses to facilitate quicker, data-driven decisions.

  - The AI assistant should have access to and consult relevant data found during shadow IT discover and other available sources when engaging in conversations and making recommendations.

- **Intelligent App Recommendations**

  - Suggest optimizations for existing SaaS applications based on usage patterns, department needs, and compliance factors.

  - Recommend tools aligned with specific business needs and user preferences.

  - Compare current SaaS usage and costs against industry standards.

  - Offer future recommendations based on historical trends and AI predictions to optimize spend.

- **Unified Spend Intelligence**

  - Provide a holistic view of all SaaS-related expenses with AI-generated analytics.

  - Identify missing vendor and contract details early and send reminders to ensure timely renewals.

**System Requirements**

- Performance needs: Handle up to 50,000 SaaS subscriptions with real-time updates.

- Security requirements: Encrypt data in transit and at rest; implement role-based access controls.

- Scalability expectations: Support SMBs scaling their operations and increasing SaaS adoption.

- Reliability targets: 99.9% uptime with real-time data backups.

- Integration constraints: Maintain compatibility with the latest API versions of integrated services.

- Open to recommendation as well
