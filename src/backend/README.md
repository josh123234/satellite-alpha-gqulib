# SaaS Management Platform - Backend Service

Enterprise-grade SaaS Management Platform backend service built with NestJS, featuring AI/ML capabilities, microservices architecture, and comprehensive security measures.

## Overview

The backend service implements a scalable microservices architecture using NestJS 10.x, providing:
- Automated SaaS discovery and tracking
- Real-time usage analytics
- AI-powered insights and recommendations
- Secure subscription management
- Multi-database integration (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.0.0 LTS
- Python >= 3.11 (for AI/ML services)
- npm >= 9.0.0
- Docker >= 24.0.0
- Docker Compose >= 2.20.0
- PostgreSQL 15.x
- MongoDB 7.x
- Redis 7.x

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start development environment:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Run migrations:
```bash
npm run migration:run
```

5. Start development server:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

## Architecture

### Microservices Structure

- Discovery Service: SaaS application detection and classification
- Analytics Service: Usage monitoring and metrics processing
- AI Service: Machine learning and natural language processing
- Notification Service: Real-time alerts and communications

### Database Architecture

- PostgreSQL: Primary relational data store
- MongoDB: Document storage for unstructured data
- Redis: Caching and real-time data

### AI/ML Integration

- TensorFlow.js (v4.10.0): Core ML processing
- BERT Models (v1.0.0): Natural language understanding
- Langchain (v0.1.x): AI assistant capabilities

## Development

### Environment Setup

The project uses Docker Compose for local development. Services include:
- API Service (NestJS)
- PostgreSQL 15
- MongoDB 7.0
- Redis 7.0

Resource limits are preconfigured in docker-compose.yml:
- API: 1GB RAM, 1.0 CPU
- PostgreSQL: 512MB RAM, 0.5 CPU
- MongoDB: 512MB RAM, 0.5 CPU
- Redis: 256MB RAM, 0.2 CPU

### Available Scripts

- `npm run start:dev`: Start development server with hot-reload
- `npm run test`: Run test suite
- `npm run test:e2e`: Run end-to-end tests
- `npm run test:cov`: Generate test coverage
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint
- `npm run format`: Format code with Prettier

## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication
- OAuth2/OIDC integration
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API key management for service-to-service communication

### Data Protection

- Field-level encryption for sensitive data
- TLS 1.3 for transport security
- Data masking in non-production environments
- Audit logging for all sensitive operations

### API Security

- Rate limiting with @nestjs/throttler
- Helmet for HTTP security headers
- CORS configuration
- Request validation using class-validator

## Testing Strategy

### Test Types

- Unit Tests: Individual component testing
- Integration Tests: Service interaction testing
- E2E Tests: Full API endpoint testing
- Performance Tests: Load and stress testing

### Coverage Requirements

- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Critical paths require 100% coverage
- Integration tests for all microservice communications

## Monitoring & Observability

### Health Checks

- Service health monitoring via @nestjs/terminus
- Database connection monitoring
- Cache system health checks
- External service dependency monitoring

### Logging

- Structured logging with Winston
- Log levels: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG
- Request/Response logging with Morgan
- Performance metric logging

### Metrics

- Request rate monitoring
- Response time tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Resource utilization metrics

## Best Practices

### Code Style

- Follow NestJS best practices
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Implement SOLID principles
- Document with JSDoc comments

### Error Handling

- Custom exception filters
- Standardized error responses
- Circuit breakers for external services
- Graceful degradation strategies

### Performance

- Implement caching strategies
- Use database indexing
- Optimize query performance
- Implement connection pooling
